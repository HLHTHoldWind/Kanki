## What is this?
- A mini program running on Windows that can show what music now are you playing.
- With some fascinating animations (I think)
- It's not a music player, it can't play anything. You have to use another music player.

## Requirement?
- Only can run on higher than Windows 10 (include)
- The music player you used must support GlobalSystemMediaTransportControlsSession class (if your player will show info at volume control bar, means it supports)
- (Note: The default Windows Media Player sometimes do not correctly show media info)
- Most of UWP music players have this function.

## How to use?
- Left click on disc to expand/fold the pause/play toolbar.
- Right click on disc to pause/play the music.
- Use the toolbar to do some simple music control.
- Use the app icon in system tray to hide/show, configurate, quit.
